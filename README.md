<h1> Blockchain Based Decentralized Cloud Storage System</h1><br>
<p>
This project aims to build a decentralized cloud storage system that utilizes blockchain technology to provide secure and efficient storage for users. The system uses ReactJS for the front-end, Solidity for the smart contracts, EtherJS for blockchain interactions, and IPFS for decentralized file storage. The system will be hosted on Google Cloud and use AMD instances for improved performance.

<br>

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/jaysomani/Blockchain-Based-Decentralized-Cloud-Storage-System.git <br>
Install dependencies: npm install<br>
Deploy Contract: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost <br>
Start It: npx hardhat node <br>
Start the development server: npm start <br>
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2><br>
After starting the development server, you can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. The application allows users to upload and download files securely, with all file data being stored on the IPFS network. Smart contracts are used to manage user authentication, file storage, and payment transactions.
